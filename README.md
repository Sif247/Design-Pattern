# Design-Pattern
### Practice exercises for the Software Engineering UNIMORE exam by Prof. Francesco Guerra
## The exercises will focus on the analysis of design patterns. The main patterns we will concentrate on are:
- Strategy
- Observer
- Decorator
- Factory
- Singleton
- Command
- Adapter
- Facade
- Template
- Iterator
- Composite
- State
- Proxy
- Builder
- Bridge
- Chain of Responsibility

# Design principles
## what we have to do before to decide one design pattern?

- Separate what we have to change from what is the same for every class
- Program to an interface to represent the behavior, not an implementation
